# Easy Concurrency in Python
This repository contains some scripts that showcase concurrent patterns in Python 3.7 using the `concurrent.futures` module of the standard library.
There is a corresponding article on my blog titled [Easy Concurrency in Python](http://pljung.de/posts/easy-concurrency-in-python/) where I discuss how the scripts work.
Each script can be run in the terminal using the `python3 script.py` command.
